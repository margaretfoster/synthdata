# synthdata
This repository is for Jupyter Notebooks that are set up as tutorials for generating synthetic data for various uses.

# Introduction
Recently, I have been using Coursera and Data Camp tutorials to upskill my Python skills and, as a bonus, fill gaps in my transition from computational social scientist to data scientist. Sometimes, I am learning new skills that were not formally covered in my training (e.g., Data Engineering in Python on Coursera). Sometimes, I am using the tutorials to translate from R and an academic framing into Python and an industry framing.

I learn new skills best via repetition, so I like to keep a Jupyter Notebook open and follow along while I watch the tutorial videos.

However, I have been running into a problem on Data Camp: I can only run the code with their sample datasets and couldn't find them for download. I could double down on searching, blindly copy down the code, and just accept that my Notebooks won't run... or I could code up some of my own synthetic data!
